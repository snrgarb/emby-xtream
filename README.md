## Features

### Live TV & EPG

Full Live TV integration with Emby's native TV guide.

- **M3U playlist generation** with channel metadata, logos, and EPG channel IDs
- **XMLTV electronic program guide** with configurable fetch window (1-14 days)
- **Category-based filtering** — select which channel groups to include
- **Stream format selection** — MPEG-TS or HLS (M3U8)
- **Adult content filtering** — opt-in toggle for adult-flagged channels
- **DVB subtitle declaration** — optional toggle that surfaces DVB subtitle tracks for live TV without re-enabling stream probing (see [ADR-009](docs/decisions/009-dvb-subtitle-static-declaration.md))
- **Automatic caching** — M3U (15 min) and EPG (30 min) with thread-safe invalidation

### VOD Movie Library

Sync on-demand movies as STRM files that Emby treats as a native movie library.

- **STRM file generation** — one file per movie, Emby handles metadata and artwork
- **Folder organization modes:**
  - **Single folder** — all movies in one `Movies/` directory
  - **Multiple folders** — auto-organized by provider category name
  - **Custom mapping** — define your own folders and assign categories to each
- **TMDB metadata matching** — appends `[tmdbid=123]` to folder names for instant Emby identification
- **TMDB fallback lookup** — queries Emby's metadata providers when the Xtream source lacks a TMDB ID
- **Category selection** — pick specific VOD categories to sync, or sync all
- **Danger zone** — one-click delete of all synced movie content

### TV Series Library

Full series support with proper season/episode structure.

- **Season/Episode STRM files** — `Show Name/Season 01/Show Name - S01E01 - Episode Title.strm`
- **Series detail fetching** — pulls episode lists per series from the Xtream API
- **TVDb / TMDB ID folder naming** — `Show Name [tvdbid=81189]` for reliable metadata matching
- **Manual ID overrides** — force a specific TVDb ID for shows that don't auto-match
- **Metadata fallback lookup** — searches Emby's providers when no ID is available
- **Same folder modes as movies** — single, multiple, or custom category mapping

### Smart Sync Engine

Efficient sync that doesn't re-download what you already have.

- **Smart skip** — skips writing STRM files that already exist on disk
- **Configurable parallelism** — 1-10 concurrent operations (default 3)
- **Orphan cleanup** — automatically removes STRM files for content no longer in the source
- **Cross-listing deduplication** — movies/series appearing in multiple categories are synced once
- **Content name cleaning** — strips provider prefix tags (e.g. `|UK|`, `|FR|`) and custom terms from titles
- **Real-time progress** — Phase, Total, Completed, Skipped, Failed counters polled every 500ms

### Dispatcharr Integration

Optional integration with [Dispatcharr](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr) for IPTV stream management.

- **Stream proxy routing** — routes Live TV through Dispatcharr's proxy for connection management
- **Pre-populated media info** — fetches codec, resolution, and bitrate from Dispatcharr's stream stats (requires [Streamflow](https://github.com/krinkuto11/streamflow) configured in Dispatcharr to generate per-channel metadata)
- **FFprobe bypass** — skips Emby's stream analysis when stats are available (faster channel switching)
- **JWT authentication** — automatic token refresh with retry and exponential backoff
- **Graceful fallback** — reverts to direct Xtream URLs if Dispatcharr is unavailable

### Built-in Dashboard

A configuration UI embedded in Emby's plugin settings with five tabs.

- **Dashboard** — last sync status, sync history (last 10), library stats, live progress bar
- **Settings** — server connection, sync tuning, name cleaning, metadata matching
- **Movies** — enable/disable, folder mode, category selection with search, sync button
- **Series** — same layout as movies with series-specific options
- **Live TV** — stream format, EPG settings, catch-up, Dispatcharr, category filtering

## Installation

### Step 1: Download the Plugin

Download `Emby.Xtream.Plugin.dll` from the [latest release](../../releases/latest).

> Only the single DLL file is needed — no other dependencies.

<details>
<summary><strong>Build from source (alternative)</strong></summary>

Requires .NET SDK 6.0+:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firestaerter3/emby-xtream.git
cd emby-xtream/Emby.Xtream.Plugin
bash build.sh
```

The compiled DLL will be at `Emby.Xtream.Plugin/out/Emby.Xtream.Plugin.dll`.

</details>

### Step 2: Install the Plugin

Copy the DLL to your Emby Server's plugins directory and restart.

**Docker (most common):**
```bash
docker cp Emby.Xtream.Plugin.dll emby:/config/plugins/
docker restart emby
```

**Bare metal (Linux):**
```bash
cp Emby.Xtream.Plugin.dll /var/lib/emby/plugins/
systemctl restart emby-server
```

**Bare metal (macOS/Windows):**
Copy `Emby.Xtream.Plugin.dll` to your Emby data directory under `plugins/`, then restart Emby Server.

### Step 3: Configure the Plugin

1. Open Emby's web UI
2. Go to **Settings > Plugins > Xtream Tuner**
3. Enter your Xtream server details:
   - **Server URL** — e.g. `http://your-provider:port`
   - **Username** and **Password**
4. Click **Test Connection** to verify
5. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Set Up Live TV

1. Switch to the **Live TV** tab
2. Choose your **Stream Format** (MPEG-TS recommended)
3. Click **Refresh Categories** to load channel groups
4. Select the categories you want
5. Configure **EPG** settings (days to fetch, cache duration)
6. Click **Save**
7. Go to **Emby Settings > Live TV** and add a new tuner:
   - Type: **Xtream Tuner**
   - It will auto-discover the plugin's M3U and EPG endpoints

### Step 5: Set Up Movies (Optional)

1. Switch to the **Movies** tab
2. Check **Enable VOD Movies**
3. Click **Refresh Categories** to load VOD categories
4. Choose a **Folder Organization** mode:
   - **Single Folder** — select categories, all movies go to `Movies/`
   - **Multiple Folders** — one folder per category, auto-named
   - **Custom** — click "Add Folder", name it, assign categories
5. Click **Sync Movies Now**
6. In Emby, add a new **Movies** library pointing to the STRM output path (default: `/config/xtream/Movies`)

### Step 6: Set Up Series (Optional)

1. Switch to the **Series** tab
2. Check **Enable Series / TV Shows**
3. Same workflow as Movies — refresh categories, select, choose folder mode
4. Click **Sync Series Now**
5. In Emby, add a new **TV Shows** library pointing to `/config/xtream/Shows`

### Step 7: Dispatcharr Integration (Optional)

If you use [Dispatcharr](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr) for stream management:

1. Go to **Live TV** tab > **Dispatcharr** section
2. Check **Enable Dispatcharr**
3. Enter Dispatcharr URL, username, and password
4. Click **Test Dispatcharr** to verify
5. Save — Live TV streams will now route through Dispatcharr's proxy

> **Note:** For the plugin to receive codec/resolution metadata and skip FFprobe, [Streamflow](https://github.com/krinkuto11/streamflow) must be enabled and configured in Dispatcharr. Without Streamflow generating per-channel stream stats, the plugin falls back to standard stream handling.

### Updating the Plugin

Download the latest DLL from [Releases](../../releases/latest), replace the file in your plugins directory, and restart Emby. Your configuration is preserved across updates.

## Security Note: Credentials in STRM Files and M3U Output

The Xtream Codes protocol requires the username and password to appear directly in every stream URL — there is no token or session form. As a result, your Xtream credentials end up embedded in plaintext in two places:

- The `.strm` files written under your **STRM Library Path** (default `/config/xtream`)
- The M3U playlist served by the plugin's tuner endpoint

This is a property of the protocol, not a plugin defect — the same is true of any Xtream-based tooling. Anything that can read those files (other containers sharing the volume, backup tools, indexers, users with shell access on the host) can harvest the credentials.

**How to keep credentials off disk:**

- **Use Dispatcharr.** When [Dispatcharr](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr) is enabled, Live TV and multi-provider VOD URLs route through Dispatcharr's credential-free proxy URLs (`/proxy/ts/stream/<uuid>`, `/proxy/vod/movie/<uuid>`) instead of the raw Xtream form. Single-provider VOD movies and series episodes still fall back to the Xtream URL today.
- **Restrict filesystem permissions.** Make sure the STRM library path is not readable by other users or containers on the host. For Docker, avoid mounting `/config/xtream` into unrelated services.
- **Use a dedicated provider account.** If your Xtream provider supports multiple credential sets per subscription, use a separate one for Emby so it can be rotated independently.

If credential exposure on disk is unacceptable for your environment, Dispatcharr in front of the plugin is currently the only complete answer. Improving credential-free routing for single-provider VOD and series episodes is tracked as a future enhancement.
